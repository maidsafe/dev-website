  title: PARSEC - Protocol for Asynchronous, Reliable, Secure and Efficient Consensus
  desc: PARSEC has been built by MaidSafe to power the SAFE Network.  PARSEC has been released under a GPL v3 licence (with linking exception) and it is free for anyone to build upon and will prove to be of immense value to other decentralised projects.
whatIs:
  title: What does PARSEC do?
  para1: PARSEC solves a well-known problem in decentralised, distributed computer networks... how can individual computers (nodes) in a system reliably communicate truths (in other words, events that have taken place on the network) to each other where a proportion of the nodes are malicious (Byzantine) and looking to disrupt the system? Or to put it another way, how can a group of computers agree on which transactions have correctly taken place and in which order?
whoFor:
  title: Where could you use PARSEC?
  para1: It could be used in any project that needs a consensus mechanism and currently uses what might be considered to be 'inferior' solutions. For instance, anywhere that is currently considering using a consensus protocol that is limited to permissioned networks but want to use them in a permission-less context. Anywhere that's currently using slower consensus mechanisms (e.g. mechanisms based on broadcast).
