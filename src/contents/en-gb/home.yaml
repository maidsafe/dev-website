  sixKeys:
    - title: The privacy-first network
      desc: Privacy and anonymity for your users. The Secure Access for Everyone (SAFE) Network is built to negate the prying eyes of internet interlopers with built-in encrypted communications.
      icon: privacy
    - title: Infrastructure-free
      desc: Easy to use APIs in many languages, means you can focus on coding. No need to worry about your infrastructure or scaling costs here!
      icon: infrastructure
    - title: Open source
      desc: All SAFE Network libraries are open source, transparent and free to use.
      icon: anonymity
    - title: Your application is the product, not your users' data
      desc: Users are always in control of their data, and with monetisation being built into the network, you can focus on making the best app, without selling your users short.
      icon: application
    - title: Network-wide sign-on
      desc: You don’t need to roll-your-own account management solutions, users log in once at the network level. With SAFE you have no passwords left to lose!
      icon: sign-on
    - title: Truly collaborative applications
      desc: With data owned by users, you can share data across applications to create and reuse data sets in new ways!

    title: PARSEC
    desc: PARSEC (Protocol for Asynchronous, Reliable, Secure and Efficient Consensus) is an algorithm which allows a section of network nodes to reach consensus on the validity and order of network events by voting on events and using a gossip protocol to disseminate these votes amongst themselves.

  title: Roadmap
  desc: The Network is in Alpha 2 and the APIs are subject to change. We do try to keep the APIs backward compatible as much as possible while the Network is progressing towards a stable beta.

      - name: Alpha 1
        icon: alpha1
        desc: Initial alpha implementation enabling users to access MaidSafe managed nodes using the SAFE Launcher to use several demo applications.
      - name: Alpha 2
        icon: alpha2
        desc: The Authenticator. The current release incorporating a more secure form of network access now bundled with the SAFE Browser.
    inprogress:
      - name: Alpha 3
        icon: alpha3
        desc: Secure Autonomous Network. An autonomous secure routing layer that will see the network architecture becoming more decentralised, enabling users to run routing nodes and providing secure transient data in the process.
      - name: Alpha 4
        icon: alpha4
        desc: Secure autonomous data services. The addition of a storage layer through the reintroduction of user run vaults facilitating a much broader range of decentralised apps and use cases.
