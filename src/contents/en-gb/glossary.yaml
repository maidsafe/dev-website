  - name: "Address and Port-Dependent Filtering"
    desc: "The NAT filters out packets not destined for the internal address X:x.  Additionally, the NAT will filter out packets from Y:y destined for the internal endpoint X:x if X:x has not sent packets to Y:y previously.  In other words, for receiving packets from a specific external endpoint, it is necessary for the internal endpoint to send packets first to that external endpoint's IP address and port."
  - name: "Address-Dependent Filtering"
    desc: "The NAT filters out packets not destined to the internal address X:x.  Additionally, the NAT will filter out packets from Y:y destined for the internal endpoint X:x if X:x has not sent packets to Y:any previously (independently of the port used by Y).  In other words, for receiving packets from a specific external endpoint, it is necessary for the internal endpoint to send packets first to that specific external endpoint's IP address."

#    desc: "Connection Attempts"
  - name: "Duration"
    desc: "Time taken to successfully establish holepunched connection, it is not the duration of the connection itself. It is only displayed for successful connections and is applicable separately to TCP Holepunch and uTP holepunch."
  - name: "EDM"
    desc: "Endpoint-Dependent Mapping refers to the combination of 'Address-Dependent Filtering' and 'Address and Port-Dependent Filtering'."
#  - name: "EDM Random"
#    desc: "More complex version of EDM where there is no fixed delta (offset) when generating the address."
#  - name: "EDM to EIM"
#    desc: ""
#  - name: "EDM to EDM Random"
#    desc: ""
  - name: "EIM"
    desc: "Endpoint-Independent Mapping allows the device to accept incoming traffic to a mapped public port from ANY external endpoint on the public network."
#  - name: "EIM to EDM Random"
#    desc: ""
#  - name: "Hairpinning"
#    desc: "Hairpinning, or NAT loopback allows two endpoints on the internal side of the NAT (router) to communicate even if they only use each other’s external IP addresses and ports."
  - name: "NAT traversal"
    desc: "NAT (Network Address Translator) Traversal is in essence a hole punching technique that exploits how NATs handle some protocols (e.g. UDP & TCP) to allow previously blocked packets through the NAT."
#  - name: "NAT Type"
#    desc: "Network Address Translation enables a device to connect to the internet. Types available to Crust are: EDM; EIM; EDM Random; EDM to EIM; EDM to EDM Random and EIM to EDM Random"
  - name: "Protocols"
    desc: "Protocols are special sets of rules that end points in a telecommunication connection use when they communicate. Protocols specify interactions between the communicating entities."
#  - name: "Protocol Acceptance"
#    desc: ""
  - name: "TCP"
    desc: "Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which uses a set of rules to exchange messages with other Internet points at the information packet level."
#  - name: "TCP Direct"
#    desc: "Direct connection between routers using TCP protocol."
#  - name: "TCP Hole Punched"
#    desc: ""
  - name: "µTP"
    desc: "Micro Transport Protocol or µTP (sometimes also uTP) is an open UDP-based variant of the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing protocol intended to mitigate poor latency and other congestion control issues found in conventional BitTorrent over TCP, while providing reliable, ordered delivery."
#  - name: "uTP Hole Punched"
#    desc: ""
#  - name: "XOR"
#    desc: "Exclusive 'OR', a mathematical or logic function that acts on binary data. 'XORing' one binary number against another, bit-for-bit (see bitwise operation), if the bits are the same (both 1 or both 0) the output is 0. If the bits are different (one or the other contains a 1) the output is 1 (see Figure A below, wherein '^' is used to invoke the XOR function). In the Safe Network, the properties of the XOR function are used to establish certain relationships between binary network addresses (see XOR space). It is also used in the self-encryption process to further obfuscate encrypted data."
#  - name: "XOR space"
#    desc: "The complete range of all possible Safe Network addresses, viewed using the XOR function. The XOR function gives this 'space' a number of interesting and useful mathematical properties, especially that regarding the mathematical 'closeness' relationship between addresses. Because of this property, from the viewpoint of any specific address, no two other addresses can have the same mathematical 'closeness' even though they may have the same numerical distance. This property allows a node on the network to always be able to calculate which node or nodes (also data or ID addresses) are 'closest' to it in comparison to others. This ability to compute relative closeness is vital in order for nodes to unambiguously form close groups which interact to effect oversight and establish consensus. Bear in mind that XOR space is a mathematical relationship amongst nodes and data with randomly assigned addresses, and therefore has no correlation to physical space or distance."
#  - name: "Zero Knowledge Proof"
#    desc: "(cryptography) A method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. --Wikipedia
